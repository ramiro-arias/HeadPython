# Can the standard library tell us what time it is? Yes. After importing 
# the time module, call the strftime function and specify how you want
# the time displayed. In this case, we are interested in the current 
# timeâ€™s hours (%H) and minutes (%M) values in 24-hour format:

import time
print("Time is now:", time.strftime("%H:%M"))
